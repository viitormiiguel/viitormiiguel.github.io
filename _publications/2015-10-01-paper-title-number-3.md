Reaction videos from YouTube provide a range of possibilities when looking to investigate human behavior. This research aims to present a method of creating a spontaneous facial expression dataset from YouTube reaction videos. In this work, we use Convolutional Neural Networks to classify emotions in facial expressions, as well as feature extraction tools to support this classification. To understand the behavior of faces that react to a given trailer, we firstly select automatically interest moments in the video where reactions were more intense and then we present two metrics: Agreement and Continuity rates, which aim to help to identify spontaneous emotions, that cannot be classified by Neural Networks with high assertiveness. Using our metrics, we found an average of 71% of the faces that present similarity of classified emotions, in the most intense moments in the video. Our proposal is to use our â€¦
