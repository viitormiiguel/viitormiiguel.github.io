The Multi-Agent Programming Contest in 2018 expanded upon the Agents in the City scenario used in the 2016 and 2017 editions of the contest. In this scenario two teams compete to score points by building and attacking wells using realistic city maps from OpenStreetMap. Wells are the main addition to the new version of the scenario; they cost money to build and generate score overtime but can be dismantled by agents from the other team. This, along with other additions, made it a significantly more complex scenario than before. In this paper, we describe the strategies used by our team, highlighting our adaptations and new additions from our participation in the previous years. We have fully explored the use of all three programming dimensions (agent, environment, and organisation) available in JaCaMo, the multi-agent system development platform that we used to implement our team. Our agents were able …
